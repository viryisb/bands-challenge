# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

This is a Development Challenge for React
This challenge aims to evaluate basic skills in React development. The idea is to build an simple data query website for music bands.

Functionality
The website has to contain the following pages/features:

Login/authentication page. The rest of the pages have to be behind this "authorization wall".
List and navigate bands Filter and sorting should be enabled.
View information of a specific band, including albums.
Logout

The login screen has been mocked to simulate user authentication because I don't have access to the given server to do this challenge.
To enter the web application you can write any email address and password. Just be careful that the form will complain if you don't write an @ in the email box. 

-It is allowed to misjudge my CSS since I do it too. I played around with the styles to make the view look a little better but it needs some more work on it-
